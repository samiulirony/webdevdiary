      "long-details": "If your air conditioner is running constantly but failing to cool the room, or if you notice ice forming on the evaporator coils, there is a very high chance that your unit is suffering from low refrigerant levels. AC units do not consume gas like a car consumes fuel; a drop in gas level means there is a leak somewhere in the system. Our AC Gas Refill service starts with a rigorous diagnostic check to identify and seal any micro-leaks in the copper tubing or connection joints, ensuring that the new gas we pump in won't just escape again within a few weeks.\n\nOnce the system is fully sealed and vacuumed to remove unwanted air and moisture, we inject the precise amount of high-grade, eco-friendly refrigerant gas (such as R-32 or R-410A) required by your specific AC model. This meticulous process restores your air conditioner's cooling capacity to its factory-level peak performance, drastically reducing the strain on your compressor. Proper gas levels also prevent the compressor from overheating and burning out, saving you from massive repair bills down the line and keeping your indoor environment refreshingly cool.",

Over time, a thick layer of sludge, dust, and microbiological growth can coat the hidden inner workings of your AC, particularly the blower fan and the innermost cooling coils. This not only chokes the airflow but also creates a breeding ground for foul odors and harmful bacteria. Our Master Wash involves partially dismantling the indoor unit, applying specialized, non-corrosive foaming chemicals that break down stubborn dirt, and then using a high-pressure water jet to flush everything out completely.\n\nThe transformation after a Master Wash is immediate and highly noticeable. The airflow volume increases significantly, the air smells fresh and clean, and the cooling speed of the room improves dramatically. By removing this heavy insulating layer of dirt from the coils, the heat exchange process becomes highly efficient again, which directly translates to lower electricity consumption. This service is highly recommended for units that haven't been serviced in over a year, or for ACs located in highly dusty environments or commercial kitchens.",

We finish the job by vacuuming the system and recharging it with the exact specification of refrigerant gas required. Our meticulous approach ensures that your refrigerator is brought back to life with reliable, long-lasting cooling power, saving you the immense cost and hassle of having to buy a completely new appliance.",

Our Washing Machine Motor Fixing service is designed to tackle all these problems across both top-load and front-load models of all major brands, providing a swift and reliable solution to get your laundry routine back on track.\n\nOur technicians will carefully dismantle the required panels to access the motor assembly, running multimeter tests to pinpoint the exact electrical or mechanical failure. Whenever possible, we focus on repairing the motor by replacing specific worn parts like bearings or brushes, which is highly cost-effective. However, if the motor is completely burnt out, we provide genuine replacement parts and install them with precision. We also recalibrate the tension belts and ensure the drum balance is perfect, leaving your washing machine running smoothly and quietly as if it were brand new.",

However, the filters inside your RO (Reverse Osmosis), UV (Ultraviolet), or UF (Ultrafiltration) system have a limited lifespan. Over time, they become clogged with mud, rust, chlorine, and dissolved solids, which not only drastically reduces the water flow rate but also compromises the quality and taste of your drinking water. Regularly changing these filters is non-negotiable for the health of your family and the longevity of the purifier's water pump.\n\nOur comprehensive filter change service includes the systematic replacement of the pre-filter, sediment filter, carbon block, and the core RO membrane using 100% genuine, food-grade spares. We also clean the internal water storage tank and check the UV lamp intensity to ensure all bacteria and viruses are being effectively neutralized. Finally, our technicians will measure the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) level of the output water to ensure it falls perfectly within the healthy, sweet-tasting range.
